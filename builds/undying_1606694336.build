			"undying_soul_rip"		"Early nuke/heal. Try to use it on lane as much as possible after you get enemy low enough with Decay. Keep in mind - your heal is directly tied to the number of units around. You can also use it to heal Tombstone OR to get more units around."
			"undying_tombstone"		"A pain to deal with in a teamfight. It also allowes you to get Roshan easier (Rosh switches aggro to zombies), take stacks (if you don&amp;apos;t have meteor/bm yet), as well as deals with enemy running away.
You can also use it on highgrounds / ward spots to make it harder to destroy for your enemies."
			"undying_flesh_golem"		"The amount of Strength is directly tied to your own strength, so you want to steal as much with Decay as possible. It also makes you a bit faster, so you want to use it in teamfights to (a) tank more and survive and (b) chase enemies down and focus them with your team."
