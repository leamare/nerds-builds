			"item_arcane_boots"		"You will have mana issues early, while also wanting to get Greaves, so Arcane boots seems like most optimal choice."
			"item_spirit_vessel"		"Armor, percentage base heal/damage, HP and movement speed. Pretty much all you may ask for."
			"item_cyclone"		"Mobility and mana, additional save as well as setup for your Q or E  (use E, wait for around 1.5 seconds, use eul)."
			"item_force_staff"		"Saves allies and works great in combo with your Q"
			"item_nullifier"		"Additional strong lockdown, while also giving armor and high damage (works great on lvl 25)"
			"item_hurricane_pike"		"Natural upgrade for Force Staff"
