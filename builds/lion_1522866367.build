			"item_aether_lens"		"Even while you don&apos;t really need much mana, this addition to your mana pool is pretty useful, while also providing significant range increase."
			"item_blink"		"The most important Lion item. If you aren&apos;t going for a full utility, you can delay it, but mobility is still essential for your initiation."
			"item_tranquil_boots"		"Mobility + HP regen"
			"item_solar_crest"		"Natural medallion upgrade. Good against autoattacking cores."
			"item_shivas_guard"		"Additional armor, mana pool, attack speed slow"
			"item_ethereal_blade"		"Potential save against physical damage"
			"item_lotus_orb"		"Additional armor and ability to purge debuffs from allies"
			"item_silver_edge"		"Additional initiation and stats"
			"item_ghost"		"Potential self-save against physical damage"
			"item_ultimate_scepter"		"It&apos;s good for utility build due to its stats, cooldown reduction and damage increase. Altho, we aren&apos;t really focused on this aspect of Lion."
			"item_assault"		"Both armor and attack speed boost. Works well for semi-carry Lion"
