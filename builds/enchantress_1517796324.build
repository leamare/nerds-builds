			"item_cyclone"		"Some mana regen, lockdown and self purge. Cheap, not really good stats-wise, but can be OK against Kunkka, Juggernaut and so on"
			"item_assault"		"Huge armor boost, armor and attack speed aura for the team, also huge attack speed boost. One of the best Ench team-orientated items."
			"item_lotus_orb"		"One of the best utility items in the game. Useful against silences and hexes, as well as direct spells."
			"item_silver_edge"		"Gives a lot of stats, attack speed and damage, mobility, additional escape and long-range utility (with Break effect)."

			"enchantress_enchant"		"Good for slowing enemies and, of course, for early farm and ganking. We want this to have ASAP to be able to farm jungle, but we don`t need more than 1 point early on."
			"enchantress_natures_attendants"		"Our main escape early. It has not really big radius and heals slowly, so we will use it only for ourself most of the time. You can learn this on lvl1 if there`s risk of dying. Try to use it before fighting: it will help you tank shit and get out."
			"enchantress_impetus"		"Our main damage source. Can be used to dominate a lane, kill those who`s trying to run away, kill couriers, defend from a distance."
			"special_bonus_unique_enchantress_2"		"Both heal and damage are good: with heal you can tank more and even try to save somebody, with damage you can farm faster and push effectively."
