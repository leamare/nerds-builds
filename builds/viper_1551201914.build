	"Role"		"#DOTA_HeroGuide_Role_Core"
	"GameplayVersion"		"7.39c"
	"Overview"		"Viper is an agility core hero who excells at slowing down enemies, dominating a lane and snowballing out of control. The hero lacks any hard controlling abilities but it has a lot of slows in return. Another thing to consider is Nethertoxin - Viper's most dangerous weapon that can make you burn out in seconds during fights or help it farm extremely fast. And the last addition to this toolset is natural tankiness against magic. Viper's weaknessess are being easy to kill with physical damage and natural lack of mobility. And finally the lack of any hard controlling abilities that may stop you from teleporting away.

			"item_sange_and_yasha"		"More of a defensive replacement for Drum or KaYasha, usually good when you need some mobility and stats"
			"item_hurricane_pike"		"Additional mobility and cheap stats. Early Force Staff works well when you&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;re playing against AoE silences, terrain lockdowns or struggle to get into attack range to enemy"
			"item_shivas_guard"		"Doubling down on your magic tank role by amplifying your armor, magic damage and increasing your crowd control abilities by standing in the middle of a fight"
			"item_butterfly"		"Great addition for hybrid core. It also allowes you to become a decent damage dealer and pusher. It&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;s also a great addition to +120 damage talent"
			"item_greater_crit"		"Nice addition to Buttterfly if you&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;re playing against tanky cores or want to burst enemies down"
			"item_assault"		"More of an utility replacement for both Butterfly and Shiva`s Guard. It helps with both tankiness, pushing and physical damage output, while also fitting theme of a walking tank"
			"item_crimson_guard"		"Against high attack speed cores, high physical damage lineups or summons"
			"item_lotus_orb"		"Against light disables (like slows and silences) in case you are not the only one struggling from them"
			"item_sheepstick"		"Additional reliable lockdown"
			"item_black_king_bar"		"Against hard disables and silences (if lotus doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;t work)"
