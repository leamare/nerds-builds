			"item_hand_of_midas"		"If you think that game is going to be super long, it's probably best choice since you don't have abilty to farm really fast."
			"item_urn_of_shadows"		"Good for surviving in fights, outlving the opponents."

			"item_assault"		"Pretty good on weaver because of our minusarmor playstyle."
