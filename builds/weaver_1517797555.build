			"item_hand_of_midas"		"If you think that game is going to be super long, it's probably best choice since you don't have abilty to farm really fast."
			"item_urn_of_shadows"		"Good for surviving in fights, outlving the opponents."
			"item_hurricane_pike"		"Bonus attack range, stats and ability to save allies once again with forcestaff active. Pretty nice, huh?"
			"item_assault"		"Pretty good on weaver because of our minusarmor playstyle."
			"item_sphere"		"Another good stat item, useful for allies (if you use it on your frontliner every time)."
