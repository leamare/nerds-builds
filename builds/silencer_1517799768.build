		"ItemTooltips"
		{
			"item_blink"		"Bonus mobility to make it harder to get closer to us"
			"item_moon_shard"		"With our high-damage output and mediocre attack speed, Moon Shard as glass-cannon type damage increase works pretty well, as well as 7th slot"
			"item_magic_wand"		"Basically, cheap stats increase, nothing more. It will never be bad choice for early game."
			"item_power_treads"		"Bonus damage from int or tankiness and attack speed. These early stats from threads are pretty strong in terms of boosting our farming speed and fighting capablities."
			"item_sheepstick"		"Instant lockdown, mana regen, a little bit of tankiness and massive int increase. Basically best item for Silencer in late game"
			"item_orchid"		"Massive damage and attack speed increase, but not really good for getting it early since getting Sheepstick early is more valuable, while RoA can replace Orchid as instant lockdown."
			"item_bloodthorn"		"Best offensive choice for any int core because of massive damage increase, can also be bought as some kind of replacement to MKB"
			"item_force_staff"		"With our mobility issues and massive damage increase from int, getting early forcestaff will be much more valuable than anything else."
			"item_hurricane_pike"		"At this point we will have Force Staff already, so upgrading it to pike will not be that expensive, while also providing a lot of good stats and attack range: those things Silencer has problems with"
			"item_refresher"		"Need double global? Well, why not. There're no other reasons to get it tho: it doesn't give us anything else we actually need"
			"item_assault"		"Safer version of Moon Shard: huge attack speed boost and armor increase, works well with Silencer's agressive playstyle"
			"item_black_king_bar"		"The item we don't really want to get, but it works well with our agressive playstyle and may serve as ultimate save item"
			"item_shivas_guard"		"With our agressive plays, pretty often bought item: massive int and armor increase, works as huge boost to our durability"
			"item_sphere"		"Massive early stats boost, works well against targeted control"
			"item_mjollnir"		"We don't really need lightnings, but Mjolnir gives us a lot of AoE damage and huge attack speed boost, so it may be good alternative to AC or Moon Shard"
			"item_skadi"		"Massive stats boost, works well with agressive playstyle, altho, it's goo only when you need raw hp increase and damage"

			"silencer_glaives_of_wisdom"		"good to have early in lane to harass opponent. Doesn't really good for maxing out early on since other spells will increase our damage much more"
			"silencer_last_word"		"Additonal lockdown, nuke and, the most valuable, vision over target"
			"special_bonus_intelligence_7"		"Armor is nice, but 7 int costs much more and, of course, with our glaives it gives not only 7 damage to us"
