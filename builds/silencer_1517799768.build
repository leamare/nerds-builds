			"item_magic_wand"		"Basically, cheap stats increase, nothing more. It will never be bad choice for early game."
			"item_power_treads"		"~13 min
Bonus damage from int or tankiness and attack speed. These early stats from threads are pretty strong in terms of boosting our farming speed and fighting capablities."
			"item_sheepstick"		"Instant lockdown, mana regen, a little bit of tankiness and massive int increase. Basically best item for Silencer in late game"
			"item_hurricane_pike"		"At this point we will have Force Staff already, so upgrading it to pike will not be that expensive, while also providing a lot of good stats and attack range: those things Silencer has problems with"
			"item_refresher"		"Need double global? Well, why not. There&apos;re no other reasons to get it tho: it doesn&apos;t give us anything else we actually need"
			"item_assault"		"Safer version of Moon Shard: huge attack speed boost and armor increase, works well with Silencer&apos;s agressive playstyle"
			"item_black_king_bar"		"The item we don&apos;t really want to get, but it works well with our agressive playstyle and may serve as ultimate save item"
			"item_shivas_guard"		"With our agressive plays, pretty often bought item: massive int and armor increase, works as huge boost to our durability"
			"item_sphere"		"Massive early stats boost, works well against targeted control"
			"item_skadi"		"Massive stats boost, works well with agressive playstyle, altho, it&apos;s goo only when you need raw hp increase and damage"
