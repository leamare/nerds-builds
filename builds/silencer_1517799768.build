Bonus damage from int or tankiness and attack speed. These early stats from threads are pretty strong in terms of boosting our farming speed and fighting capablities."

			"item_black_king_bar"		"The item we don&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;t really want to get, but it works well with our agressive playstyle and may serve as ultimate save item"
