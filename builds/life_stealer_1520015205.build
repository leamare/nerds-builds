	"Overview"		"Lifestealer is a strength core hero who is extremely good against high HP targets. His skillset allowes him to outlive opponents in fights and be durable, while Feast gives him damage based on enemy HP.
Lifestealer lacks three things: attack speed, armor and mobility. He is also good at fighting early, using minus armor to amplify his damage. This idea is what his classic playstyle is built around.
Since 7.07 there is a new way to play the hero, which is based on increasing his farming power with radiance, as well as amplify his damage and early Roshan potential with Solar Crest. That way he becomes durable tank, while also being able to fight early and get Radiance in a good timing window.

The build is part of Nerd's Hero Build Project. Other builds and additional information: https://leamare.github.io/nerds-builds/"

		"ItemTooltips"
		{
			"item_radiance"		"~15-19 mins
Farming tool and durability tool. Combines well with Open Wounds (lifesteal from burn damage) and gives us miss chance, that may work as armor in a way."
			"item_solar_crest"		"~18-22 mins
Makes Lifestealer even more tanky, but also gives him damage and Rosh potential."
			"item_sange_and_yasha"		"~25 min
Amplifies our mobility even further, as well as attack speed. Gives a lot of HP as a bonus.

			"item_manta"		"Good SnY replacement if you need to deal with silences. In other cases it's not that good."
			"item_blink"		"Works well if you need to catch off guard somebody like Sniper"
